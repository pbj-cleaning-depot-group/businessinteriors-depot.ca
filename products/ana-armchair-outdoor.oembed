{"product_id":"ana-armchair-outdoor","title":"Ana Armchair, Outdoor","description":"\u003cp\u003eAna: the piece named after Aristeu’s beloved. This chair’s comfort continues long into the evening starting with pre-, during and post-dinner conversation, victuals and drinks. Sporting just a hint of a tilt or swing as the seat moves toward but doesn’t quite connect to the hind legs (ever a nod to the ubiquitous swinging Brazilian hammock), she is steady and sweet and remains comfortable all night long. Solid, remarkable with a touch of intrigue best visible from her profile view, she holds her own.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutdoor dining chair by \u003ca href=\"http:\/\/sossegodesign.com\/designers\/\"\u003eAristeu Pires\u003c\/a\u003e handcrafted from Brazilian wood.
